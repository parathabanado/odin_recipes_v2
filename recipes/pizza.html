        <li><em>Bake the Pizza</em>: Transfer the pizza to the preheated oven and bake for 10-15 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is bubbly and melted.</li>
        <li><em>Finish</em>: Remove the pizza from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes before slicing. Drizzle with extra virgin olive oil and sprinkle with grated Parmesan cheese, if desired. Serve hot and enjoy your delicious plain cheese pizza!</li>
