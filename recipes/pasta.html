    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><em>Cook the Pasta</em>: Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the pasta according to package instructions until al dente. Drain and set aside.</li>
        <li><em>Prepare the White Sauce</em>: In a saucepan, melt butter over medium heat. Add minced garlic and sauté until fragrant. Gradually whisk in the flour until a smooth paste forms (roux). Cook for 1-2 minutes, stirring constantly.</li>
        <li><em>Make the Sauce</em>: Slowly pour in the milk, whisking continuously to prevent lumps. Cook the sauce until it thickens and coats the back of a spoon. Add grated cheese and stir until melted and smooth. Season with salt and black pepper to taste.</li>
        <li><em>Sauté Vegetables</em> (optional): In a separate pan, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add vegetables of your choice and sauté until tender.</li>
        <li><em>Combine Pasta and Sauce</em>: Add the cooked pasta to the white sauce. Toss until the pasta is evenly coated with the sauce. If using sautéed vegetables, add them to the pasta as well.</li>
        <li><em>Serve</em>: Transfer the white sauce pasta to serving plates. Garnish with chopped parsley and red chili flakes, if desired. Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
